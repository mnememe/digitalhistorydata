202,Disaster Event,Complex Emergencies - Lake Illawarra,"The Lake Illawarra was a steel single screw steam turbine motor vessel, bulk carrier. The Lake Illawarra sank after running into and demolishing part of the Tasman Bridge that crossed the Derwent River at Hobart, 5 January 1975. The vessel was en route from Port Pirie in South Australia with a cargo of zinc. When approaching the bridge, the captain reduced speed, but was finding it difficult to align the ship to the central navigation span of the bridge. Despite several attempts to change the course, the ship was difficult to manage in part due to the lack of speed. The master finally called out full speed astern in a last attempt to change the course of the ship when the ship veered into the pile capping of Pier 18 and then Pier 19 bringing the three unsupported spans of the bridge crashing into vessels' hull. The ship sank within minutes in deep water.  Seven crew members on the ship died and four cars ran over the gap into the Derwent River, five occupants died while others managed to escape from the two vehicles which teetered on the edge of the gap. The collapse effectively divided Hobart in two. Police and emergency services were called into action and within an hour a ferry was traversing the river. The next day there were three private ferries and one government run ferry in operation. Eastern shore residents were severely hindered by the collapse as most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices were located on the west shore.  A temporary bridge (the Bailey bridge) with one lane in each direction was built and opened to traffic on 16 December 1975.

40,Disaster Event,Transport - Brooklyn Train Collision,"On 6 May 1990, a Sydney-bound commuter train travelling from Newcastle crashed into the rear of a stalled chartered steam train. The 3801 locomotive, also bound for Sydney, had stopped on a rise from the Hawkesbury River and was building up steam to get up the grade (Cowan Bank) when the Sydney bound train emerged from the Boronia tunnel near Brooklyn and collided with the 3801.  The accident happened 5 km south of the Brooklyn Bridge, between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Cowan. A total of 93 people were injured and six people died. The front of the four-carriage Sydney train was derailed in the accident.  An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the New South Wales railway system.  A Coronial inquiry found that a railway signal fault occurred due to sand being dumped on the rail by the driver of 3801 to provide traction when the train went into a violent wheel-spin as it approached the Boronia tunnel. A handbrake in one of the steam train's carriages may have been partially applied, the inquiry found, to cause the train to slow down. Just outside the tunnel, the driver opened the valve to full throttle and the steam train pulled to a complete stop and more sand was applied to the rails.  While the 3801 was attempting to climb the hill, the Sydney - Newcastle train was stopped at a red signal on the other side of the tunnel. The lights apparently fluctuated from red to green seemingly because of sand on the rails. When the lights stayed permanently on the green the urban train moved forward through the tunnel, when the crash with 3801 occurred. The force of the impact destroyed the last carriage of the historic train and demolished the front carriage of the Sydney train.  Those involved in the incident were cleared of blame, however, it was said that although the signals had tested satisfactorily, the sand applied to the line by 3801 may have caused them to malfunction on the day.",1990-06-05,1990-06-05,-33.54511642,151.2256012,"-33.54511642,151.2256012",,,,93,6,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New South Wales,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40,

269,Disaster Event,"Flood - Grafton, Kempsey and North Coast New South Wales","The development of a low-pressure system off the New South Wales North Coast caused torrential rain on 2 March, and dissipated into Queensland. Heavy rainfalls intensified over the following days, particularly in the Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie regions.  River systems in the region were at capacity and tidal systems in correlation with the king tides caused further complexities with rising flood water. The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m.

Some examples are:    Kellyville, hail 5 cm,  Blacktown, hail 4 cm,  Kings Langley, hail 3 cm,  Quakers Hill, hail 3 cm,  Greystanes, heavy rain and hail 4 cm,  Potts Hill, hail 2-3 cm,  Castle Hill, hail 4-5 cm,  Greenacre, hail 4-5 cm,  St Ives, heavy rain and hail 2 cm,  Wahroona, heavy rain and hail 3 cm,  Gosford, hail 4 cm and Terrigal hail 4-5 cm.    Flash flooding was seen in Bexley (metropolitan Sydney) and in North Ryde. A thunderstorm and possible tornado caused severe local wind damage, bringing down trees and power lines, resulting in power outages to thousands of homes.  The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.  Victoria  Substantial rainfall was reported in many areas of Victoria with 24 hour rainfall totals exceeding 150 mm in many places. Rainfall in the Melbourne metropolitan area exceeded 100 mm with an all time 24 hour record for Melbourne set at 120.2 mm (the previous record was 108 mm).  The highest wind gusts were recorded at Wilson's Promontory with gusts of up to 148 km per hour. In the Melbourne area wind gusts to 104 km per hour were recorded at Fawkner and Beacon.  Extensive damage to buildings was reported and over 7000 requests for assistance were received by the SES and other emergency services over the following days.  Tasmania  During this storm, Tasmania experienced widespread damage particularly from wind gusts. The strong south easterly winds caused damage from Devonport to Bridport, Scottsdale and Winnaleah in the north-east, Binalong Bay on the East Coast, and to Flinders Island in Bass Strait. Port Sorell (near Devonport) reported many homes to be badly damaged in part due to falling trees.  Approximately 25 yachts in the Tamar River broke their moorings, with 14 reportedly destroyed, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars damage.  The Bass Strait ferry Spirit of Tasmania l was forced to return to Melbourne after sustaining damage in seas estimated at 20 m. The Spirit of Tasmania II was delayed on its voyage from Devonport to Melbourne, while the Spirit of Tasmania III broke its moorings in Devonport and was also slightly damaged.  Fruit crops sustained up to 50 per cent loss; particularly apple and pear growers. Damage was also sustained to poppy and grain crops.  Strong winds battered Tasmania during this storm, some examples are; Mount Wellington 104 km per hour, Mount Read 93 km per hour, Eddystone Point 117 km per hour, Flinders Island Airport 100 km per hour, Launceston Airport 94 km per hour and Cape Bruny on Bruny Island 91 km per hour.  On 3 February substantial rainfall accompanied the storm and flooding occurred in several areas on the east coast, some suburbs of Hobart and in the south-east. The Browns River at Kingston broke its banks causing local flooding with several minor landslides also reported in the area.  South Australia  Gale force winds of up to 67 km per hour occurred at several locations in South Australia during this storm event. These occurred in Marree and briefly at Hindmarsh Island.

22,Disaster Event,Bushfire - Great Divide Complex,"Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

17,Disaster Event,Severe Storm -  New South Wales East Coast Low,"In June 2007 there were five east coast lows off the coast of New South Wales. The first and most severe occurred over 8-9 June. Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea. This trough was directing a humid north-east to south-east air stream across north-east New South Wales and there was a weak low analysed just off the coast near Coffs Harbour on 8 June. The low moved south along the New South Wales coast, before moving out into the Tasman Sea on 10 June 2007.  Thunderstorms caused record breaking flooding in Newcastle, with 164.6 mm of rain falling in 6 hours from 3 pm to 9 pm, causing many shops and businesses to flood and hundreds of cars to be stranded or swept away. This storm event is often associated with the grounding of the Pasha Bulker (a 40,000 tonne bulk carrier ship) which occurred on 8 June on Nobbys Beach in Newcastle and was not re-floated until 2 July. Approximately 6000 people were evacuated from Maitland (near Newcastle) when it was considered that a levee may have burst.  In the Hunter Valley it was reported as the worst flooding in 52 years. Major flooding in the Hunter River occurred from 8 to 13 June and in the Paterson and Williams River from the 8 to 9 June. Moderate flooding occurred in the Wyong, Colo and Nepean Rivers.  Ferry services were cancelled on Sydney Harbour due to the weather conditions. The Cremorne wharf collapsed and sank due to large ocean swells. Beaches were eroded at many Sydney locations, due to swells up to 14 metres high. High winds blew beach sand over 100 metres inland. Over 200,000 homes reportedly lost power in the Sydney - Newcastle area due to flooding and high winds. Many thousands of homes and businesses lost telephone services when telephone exchanges were flooded.  A natural disaster was declared in the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast areas. There were a total of nine fatalities associated with the storm. Nearly 20,000 calls for assistance were made to the State Emergency Service.

Areas of raised dust were reported from the western half of the state, with visibility down to 200 m in some places.  The heaviest rainfall totals were from Falls Creek (Rocky Valley Dam) with 50 mm and Wilsons Promontory with 26 mm. The storm sent vegetation and debris flying, caused major disruption to Melbourne traffic and public transport systems and&nbsp;extensive damage to the electricity distribution network. Lanes were closed on the Westgate bridge where wind gusts were close to 120 km per hour, many traffic lights were out and conditions on the roads were chaotic. Several boats were washed ashore at Mornington, where large waves were observed.  There were reports that two people died as a result of this storm in Victoria.  More than 9,500 requests for assistance were received by emergency service agencies across the State between 2-7 April 2008 as a result of this event.  The Department of Human Services (DHS) coordinated Red Cross and local government to support the community with recovery, distributing 864 personal hardship grants totalling $240,115.  South Australia  An intense low on 2 April produced widespread wind gusts in excess of 90 km per hour across the Mount Lofty Ranges, Kangaroo Island and the South East districts of South Australia.  Tasmania  A deep low pressure system passed close to Tasmania bringing destructive winds from late 2nd April until early the next day with individual wind gusts well over 100 km per hour recorded at several locations. More than 40,000 premises lost power with at least 200 fallen power lines caused road closures. Many buildings lost their roofs. The pressure at Maatsuyker Island dipped to 966.2 hPa on 3 April the second lowest mean sea level pressure ever reported in Tasmania. Strong and gusty winds on 2 April caused a dust storm in the southern Midlands.  The estimated damage bill was around two million dollars.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2008 damage at $65 million across the three states, with the 2011&nbsp;estimated normalised cost of $79 million.",2008-02-04,2008-02-04,-38.22995377,143.8007355,"-38.22995377,143.8007355",,,,,2,65000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tasmania;South Australia;Victoria,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=493,
492,Disaster Event,Chemical - Varanus Island Gas Explosion,"At approximately 1.30 pm on 3 June 2008, an explosion at the Apache Energy Varanus Island gas processing facility's 30 cm gas pipeline caused it to rupture and fires to start. Approximately 153 staff were evacuated from the plant. Nobody was injured, but the facilities were forced to close temporarily.  The incident caused Western Australia's domestic gas supply to be cut by 30 per cent, as the Varanus Island facility is a major exporter of gas to the mainland. The largest impact was felt by major industry partners of Apache Energy such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Burrup Fertilisers, but the disruption in gas supplies also affected small businesses. A survey by the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry found that of 300 businesses surveyed, almost half said they had been affected by the energy shortage.  The West Australian Government laid claims against Apache Northwest Pty Ltd and its co-licencees, Kufpec Australia Pty Ltd and Tap (Harriet) Pty Ltd for 'failing to maintain a pipeline in good condition and repair'. However after more than two years of litigation, the state government made a public statement that they were discontinuing the prosecution due to legal technicalities.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2008 damage at $230 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $279 million.",2008-03-06,2008-03-06,-20.60193634,115.5761719,"-20.60193634,115.5761719",,,,,,230000000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Western Australia,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=492,

499,Disaster Event,Flood - South-East Queensland Dec 2007,"Torrential rain and gale force winds caused wide-spread damage to the regions around south-east Queensland. The heavy rainfall was a direct result of a low pressure system that persisted over the coral sea. Furthermore, the system combined with an upper low to produce the heavy deluge. Towns affected included Boonah, Brisbane City, Clifton, Cooloola, Logan, Gold Coast City, Stanthorpe and Warwick.  There was widespread damage to local infrastructure including bridges, roads and railways. State Emergency Services engaged the assistance of Queensland Rail and Emergency Management Queensland to support those affected by the floods.&nbsp;Assistance included extra rail services and deployment of a helicopter to support the recovery effort.&nbsp;   The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2008 damage $15 million, with the 2011 estimated normalised cost of $17 million.

498,Disaster Event,Bushfire - Boorabbin National Park,"At approximately 3 pm on 28 December 2007, a fire began on the north side of the Great Eastern Highway, 80 km west of Coolgardie. It was a hot, dry and windy day, with Southern Cross and Kalgoorlie registering maximum temperatures of 37.4 &deg;C and 41.7 &deg;C, creating extreme fire weather conditions. The fire spread rapidly in a northerly direction in the Boorabbin National Park.  On 30 December 2007, a strong northerly wind change caused breakaways from the containment lines and the fire crossed the Great Eastern Highway from north to south. Roadblocks were established; however several escorted convoys of vehicles were permitted to travel through the fire area.  A convoy of vehicles from Coolgardie arriving at the eastern side of the fire, without an escort, drove into the fire area. Several trucks were engulfed in flames, resulting in three deaths.  The highway remained closed until containment lines were completed and a fall-back strategy was implemented on 9 January 2008. The final size of the fire was 39,630 ha.  An inquiry into the deaths found three dominating causes - the expectations of fire behaviour in shrubland fuels at night; the procedures for managing road blocks; and the strategic assessment of the fire's potential; but concluded that there were many complex, interacting contributing factors and extenuating circumstances that lead to the incident outcomes.",2007-12-28,2008-08-01,-31.23159218,120.1804733,"-31.23159218,120.1804733",,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Western Australia,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=498,
496,Disaster Event,Flood - North Coast New South Wales,"Rainfall in excess of 200 mm on the night of 3 January resulted in flooding on the NSW north coast, including Kyogle and near Mullumbimby.&nbsp;The State Emergency Service (SES) received more than&nbsp;80 requests for assistance.&nbsp;In Kyogle, the SES evacuated 30 people from a caravan park and responded to two landslide incidents. A caravan park was evacuated&nbsp;in Lismore as flooding of local roads occurred. The heavy rainfall resulted in flood warnings for a number of catchments including the Tweed, Richmond, Wilsons, Bellinger, Orara and Clarence Rivers.  By 6 January, there were several thousand people isolated by floodwaters. The&nbsp;SES worked with the Department of Community Services to evacuate an Aboriginal community of around 160 residents at Cabbage Tree Island near Woodburn, threatened by flooding waters. Supply operations were undertaken by SES volunteers via helicopter, floodboat and high-clearance 4WD vehicles. Approximately 80 air support supply tasks were completed over a five day period.

487,Disaster Event,Epidemic - H1N1 Pandemic,"In April 2009, a new strain of influenza A virus called 'H1N1 2009 influenza' was identified in Mexico. Because of the speed the virus spread around the world and the fact that it was a new strain of flu, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in June 2009. This H1N1 influenza strain is referred to as both 'pandemic flu' and 'swine flu'.  The first case of this new pandemic strain of flu in Australia was in May 2009. By February 2010 there were over 5000 people hospitalised and nearly 200 deaths due to pandemic flu. Reports indicate that most of those who died had underlying medical conditions, including cancer, diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity. The median age of death was 53 years, compared to the median age of death from seasonal flu from 2001 to 2006, which was 83 years.  The then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announced in a media release that as of 1 December 2010 Australia's Pandemic Phase moved from PROTECT to ALERT which signified the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Australia. The Department of Health and Ageing reported that there were 44,403 confirmed cases of swine flu in Australia since May 2009, including 6767 in 2010.

On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.&nbsp; This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink.

Flood warnings were issued for the Macleay, Severn, Macintyre, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi and Peel Rivers.New South Wales State Emergency Service volunteers prepared Wee Waa with food and emergency supplies, with predictions that the swollen Namoi River would isolate the town for some days. The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.

502,Disaster Event,"Bushfire - Perth Hills, Western Australia 2011","In early February 2011, high fire danger conditions resulted in total fire bans being declared for Perth.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Over the weekend of 5 and 6 February, two major bushfires broke out across metropolitan Perth. One fire affected the suburbs of Roleystone and Kelmscott&nbsp;in the south-east and the other, the suburbs of Red Hill, Herne Hill, Millendon, Baskerville and Gidgegannup in the north-east.  Seventy-one homes were destroyed and an estimated 39 homes damaged by the Roleystone fire, which was started accidentally by angle-grinder sparks. Approximately 440 ha were burned at Roleystone and 1100 ha burned at Red Hill.  Approximately 517 families were evacuated and at least 12 people were hospitalised.

508,Disaster Event,Earthquake - Japan,"On Friday 11 March, an earthquake measuring 9 on the Richter Scale occurred off the north-east coast of Japan. It triggered a 10 m tsunami that caused extensive damage. The most heavily impacted areas were Sendai city, Miyagi and Fukushima prefecture.  A nuclear emergency was declared following explosions at various nuclear plants in the Fukushima area. Abnormally high levels of radioactive substances were later detected in seawater 100 m from the plant.  Due to radiation concerns, Japan halted some food shipments, which included the suspension of milk and certain vegetables from regions around the plant after abnormal radiation levels were found in the products.  There were 1964 registered Australians in Japan at the time of the earthquake, with 229 Australians registered in the affected areas.  The Australian Government assisted in recovery by providing $10 million to Red Cross Japan and also the Pacific Disaster Appeal. A transport aircraft was also deployed along with search and rescue teams to assist with the relief and recovery.  The World Bank estimated the disaster could cost the world's third-biggest economy up to $235 billion.  Notable aftershocks that occurred since the 11 March 2011 earthquake included: On 28 March 2011 at 7.24 am local time, aftershocks measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale with the epicentre at a depth of 17km. On 7 April 2011 a tremor measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, 25 miles deep in northeast Japan killed three people. Four million people were immediately plunged into darkness when two power plants were knocked offline.On 11 April 2011 a tremor measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale with the epicentre depth of 10 km, occurred in Fukushima prefecture triggered a brief tsunami warning, where workers evacuated the damaged Fukushima nuclear plant.

3315,Disaster Event,Environmental - The Big Dry,"The Big Dry was a period of drought that commenced in 1996, worsening in 2002 and 2007 with Australia finally being declared drought free in April 2012.  Southern areas of Victoria and South Australia and north-eastern area of Tasmania starting experiencing periods of rainfall deficiency in 1996. Conditions improved temporarily in these states by around 1999-2000 when the south-west of Western Australia and southern Queensland commenced experiencing rainfall deficiencies.  By August 2002 severe rainfall deficiencies developed across much of eastern Australia following poor autumn and early winter rains. Parts of south-west Western Australia were deficient in growing season rainfall for the third successive year. All states were affected. January 2003 was one of the driest months on record. Most of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and parts of Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia were affected. In February, Queensland and New South Wales received some relieving rainfall; however June rains were still well below average.  In January 2004 the Bureau of Meteorology announced 18 month rainfall deficiencies in part of eastern and northern Australia. This made it to 23 months by June. In general the south-east areas of Australia received below average rainfall for most of the last eight year period. Good rains in November removed or decreased rainfall deficiencies over many areas, with some deficiencies persisting in southern parts of Western Australia and central Queensland.  The year 2005 saw rainfall deficiencies in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Victoria and South Australia had the driest autumn on record. Good rains in October and November improved conditions in Queensland. In the years 2006-2007, Australia experienced an El Nino event. June 2006 saw poor to record low autumn rains for the sixth year in south-eastern Australia. A distinct turn for the worse occurred in August when near total failure of late winter and spring rains occurred. In June 2007 some easing of severe drought conditions had occurred from autumn rains in New South Wales, north-west Victoria, Tasmania, southern parts of South Australia. Some areas of east Queensland, southern Victoria (near Melbourne) and west Western Australia missed out. May 2008 was the driest May on record and rainfall deficiencies were evident for a 12 month period in eastern South Australia, southern Northern Territory and parts of Victoria and Western Australia.  November 2008 rainfall was above to very much above average over much of Australia. The rain largely cleared short-term rainfall deficiencies, especially in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia; however, average to below average falls in western Victoria and south-eastern South Australia maintained deficiencies in these areas.  The autumn of 2010 was the first autumn with above average rainfall since 2000 in Victoria and the Murray Darling Basin. Serious to severe rainfall deficiency continued in the western area of Western Australia, some shortfall in southern Tasmania and north-eastern New South Wales. Due to excessively dry soils significant rain was required to alleviate the shortage of water across the country resulting from prolonged drought conditions.  December 2010 saw Australia record the wettest spring for the months of September to November with an average of 163 mm of rain beating the previous record by 23 mm. The widespread above average rainfall again missed the south-west corner of Western Australia which experienced a record dry year. Northern and eastern parts of the country continued to receive above to very much above average rainfall, with Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory all recording their wettest spring on record. All states recorded above average rainfall for spring, with all states except Tasmania recording totals placing them in their ten wettest springs on record.  Despite the above average rainfall by mid-2010 water storages had still not returned to pre-drought levels. Irrigated industries such as the Murray-Darling Basin were particularly affected where water storage levels fell to 17 per cent of capacity in 2003 and remained below pre-drought levels until late 2011.  By mid-2010 the Australian Government had paid approximately $4.4 billion in direct drought assistance to affected farmers.  The Federal Government declared Australia drought-free for the first time in more than ten years in April 2012.",1996-01-01,2012-01-04,-28.61345863,148.8867188,"-28.61345863,148.8867188",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Queensland;New South Wales;Australian Capital Territory;Victoria;South Australia;Western Australia;Outside Australia;Northern Territory;Tasmania,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3315,
602,Disaster Event,Environmental - South Australia and Victoria Heatwave,"From Friday 30 December 2011 to 4 January 2012 South Australia and Victoria endured extreme temperatures.  On 1 January 2012 Adelaide recorded its hottest New Year's Day since 1900 with a maximum temperature of 41.6 &ordm; C. On 2 January Mount Gambier reached a maximum of 41.7 &ordm; C and Renmark hit 42.3 &ordm; C. These temperatures prompted a South Australian power company to cut electricity supplies to approximately 3300 properties on the Fleurieu Peninsula on 2 January.  On 2 January Victoria recorded temperatures in the forties, with Melbourne reaching 40 &ordm; C and Dartmoor in the south-west recording the state&rsquo;s maximum of 43 &ordm; C. Victoria's ambulance service treated 45 patients for heat-related illnesses, including four cases of children left in cars. A 30 per cent increase in fainting episodes was experienced.  A spokesman for Life Saving Victoria reported 163 rescues occurred during the period 31 December to 2 January.  Approximately 450 people in Melbourne's outer west suburb of Sunbury were without power when a power kiosk failed to cope with the increased demand. A replacement kiosk was installed but caught fire soon after. A spokesman for the power company said an increase in consumption is believed to have caused the original outage.  In some regions on 2 January the temperature reached 40 &ordm; C, the wind speed was 50 km per hour and the relative humidity was at 21 per cent; creating extreme fire conditions. The Victorian Country Fire Authority responded to 200 fires throughout the state, including 21 grass fires. The worst fires were in the state's south-west, with the largest blaze in Koroit, which spread over 15 ha and took 15 crews and two aircraft to control.  A total fire ban was issued across most of Victoria and South Australia.  A severe fire warning was given to the central district and Victoria's north-western regions and the Country Fire Service ordered a total fire ban in 13 of the state's 15 districts.",2011-12-30,2012-04-01,-34.12544632,140.9765625,"-34.12544632,140.9765625",,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,South Australia,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=602,

Air quality measurements at the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage were among the highest ever recorded on the air quality index, with pollution readings of&nbsp;up to 2500. Anything above 100 is considered poor air quality.  As a result, there was a significant increase in the number of people treated for asthma and breathing problems. NSW Health recorded that at the height of the bushfires, 228 people attended hospital with breathing difficulties and 778 others were treated by NSW Ambulance staff. The environmental branch within NSW Health reported a 124 per cent increase in patients with asthma conditions seeking hospital treatment.  The blanket of haze continued at varying levels for a couple of weeks. On 2 November, smoke again engulfed Sydney, setting off hundreds of automatic smoke alarms in the city and surrounding districts.

In October 1919 the government paid a &pound;1 million grant to farmers, due to low yields on wheat, reduction in butter production and sheep losses were approximately 10 million.  Tasmania  The orchards in the Derwent Valley were hard hit and in many areas water was carted by rail.  Queensland  By the end of 1918 the whole of the state was affected. Many rivers dried up. Darling Downs and surrounding areas were worst hit. The farming sector was severely impacted with reduced production in wheat, sugar and butter; and sheep losses totalled approximately 1.5 million.  Victoria  The drought impact was much less severe in Victoria than the other states.  South Australia  Lake Eyre and surrounding districts were affected the most. Some crops were a total failure resulting in a low wheat yield. Many sheep and cattle perished.  Western Australia  Sheep and cattle losses were high in the Fortescue area.

It departed from Circular Quay, Sydney harbour for Watsons Bay at 4.15 pm on 3 November 1927 with an estimated 120 passengers on board.  At approximately 4.45 pm the Greycliffe veered to port, not realising that the 140 m, 7700 ton luxury passenger liner and mail ship RMS Tahiti was 100 m behind it. The Tahiti was travelling at a speed of 12 knots, and with such a small distance between the two vessels it was too late for the Tahiti to change direction or stop.  The Tahiti collided with the Greycliffe, rolling it over and cleaving it in two. The superstructure collapsed and many were killed by the hull and propellers as they ploughed through the ferry.  The Greycliffe's boiler imploded on contact with the cold water and the ship began to sink. Many went down with it. The collision caused the deaths of 40 people, including six children returning home from school.  On 8 January 1928 the Court of Marine Inquiry found the captain on the Tahiti responsible for the collision due to failure to observe harbour regulations and travelling approximately four knots over the speed limit. He was suspended from service.  The Coronial Inquiry, conducted concurrently with the Court of marine Inquiry, however found both captains negligent but not criminally so.  The Admiralty Court found that the major initiator of the incident was the turn of the Greycliffe without warning, observation or care. The court found that both parties were negligent but the Greycliffe held three fifths of the negligence as its turn was greater than reasonable or necessary.  On March 1990 an appeal in the Full Court upheld the decision of the Admiralty Court, however giving more negligence to the Captain of the Greycliffe with two thirds responsibility.

The highest rainfall totals were recorded in the high country of the north-east and there was a secondary area of very heavy rain south of the Burnie/Ulverstone area. In both cases up to 500 mm of rain fell in three days.  During the floods 22 people drowned. Fourteen people died when the Briseis Dam at Derby burst its banks and a torrent of water travelled three miles through the narrow gorge of the Cascade River to the township of Derby carrying with it trees and tonnes of debris which inflicted serious damage.  In the town of Avoca the river was measured at approximately 17 m above the average summer level. When the waters finally receded, the railway station had disappeared, railway tracks were undermined and twisted, bridges were destroyed and debris blocked the railway line. Many road bridges in the north and north-east were lost.  On the north coast most rivers were severely flooded. At Gawler, near Ulverstone, a truck crashed through a bridge into a flooded river, drowning eight people.  In the Tamar Valley flood waters caused the river to rise to record levels. Flood waters passed through Cataract Gorge and combined with floodwaters from the North Esk, inundated more than 1,000 houses in the low-lying parts of Launceston. Some 3,500 people were evacuated. The power station at Duck Reach was washed away.  In southern Tasmania the rain was substantial and caused rivers to flow across roads and many livestock were lost. Southeasterly gales accompanying the rain swept the Derwent Valley on 4 April, damaging houses and felling trees.  The flood damage to the environment and man-made structures, particularly in the north, took many weeks to repair.",2029-03-04,2029-06-04,-41.05178452,145.9071045,"-41.05178452,145.9071045",,,,,22,,,,,,,100,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tasmania,,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=326,
